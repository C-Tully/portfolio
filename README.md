# Read me - Portfolio 2023

This project will utilize the following
- php7.2.6
- Laravel version 7.0
- Composer
- SASS
- Webpack

## Getting started

Assuming you've already installed on your machine: PHP (>= 7.0.0), [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
Note: I am leaving these default install instructions here for the time being.

``` bash
# install dependencies
composer install
npm install

# create .env file and generate the application key
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# build CSS and JS assets
npm run dev
# or, if you prefer minified files
npm run prod
```

Then launch the server:

``` bash
php artisan serve
```

The Laravel sample project is now up and running! Access it at http://localhost:8000.
